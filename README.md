## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Internet connection for initial data fetch

### Installation

1. **Clone or download the files:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository> # or download the files
   cd sleeper
   ```

2. **Set up Python environment:**
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install requests
   ```

### Basic Usage

#### Step 1: Fetch League Data

**Option 1: Using Command Line (Quick Start)**

1. **Run the script with your league ID:**
   ```bash
   python sleeper_league_data.py YOUR_LEAGUE_ID
   ```
   
   Example:
   ```bash
   python sleeper_league_data.py 1264686617134628864
   ```

**Option 2: Using .env File (Recommended for Automation)**

1. **Create a .env file** in your sleeper directory:
   ```env
   # Copy this content to a file named ".env"
   SLEEPER_LEAGUE_ID=1264686617134628864
   ```

2. **Run the script** (no arguments needed):
   ```bash
   python sleeper_league_data.py
   ```

**This will:**
- Fetch all league data from Sleeper API
- Save data to JSON files
- Create `web_interface_data.json` for the web interface
- Display league summary in the terminal

#### Step 2: View the Web Interface

After fetching the data, you can view it using the included web interface:

**Option 1: Using the Included Server Script (Recommended)**

```bash
./start_server.sh
```

Or with a custom port:
```bash
./start_server.sh 8080
```

**Option 2: Using Python's Built-in Server**

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

**Option 3: Using Any Web Server**

Since the files are now static HTML, you can serve them with any web server (Apache, Nginx, etc.) or even open them directly in a browser via file:// (though HTTP serving is recommended to avoid CORS issues).

#### Web Interface Features

The interface includes two main views:

- **Team Rosters** (`index.html`): Complete roster breakdowns and standings
- **Player Points** (`sleeper_web_interface.html`): Week-by-week analysis with dropdown selection

**Features:**
- **Navigation**: Switch between views using the navigation buttons
- **Week Selection Dropdown**: Choose any week to analyze player performance
- **Detailed Player Cards**: Points, positions, teams, and starter indicators
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Static Files**: No server-side processing required

## üîÑ Scheduling Automatic Updates

**Current Status**: The data fetching script does NOT automatically run on a schedule. You need to run it manually each time you want updated data.

### Option 1: Manual Updates
Run the data fetching script whenever you want fresh data:
```bash
# With command line argument
python sleeper_league_data.py YOUR_LEAGUE_ID

# Or with .env file (recommended)
python sleeper_league_data.py
```

After fetching new data, the web interface will automatically show the updated information when you refresh your browser.

### Option 2: Set Up Automated Scheduling

#### On macOS/Linux (using cron):

1. **Edit your crontab:**
   ```bash
   crontab -e
   ```

2. **Add a scheduled job** (example: update data every hour during season):
   ```bash
   # Update league data every hour from September through January (using .env file)
   0 * * 9-12,1 * cd /path/to/sleeper && source venv/bin/activate && python sleeper_league_data.py
   
   # Or update every 30 minutes on game days (Sunday/Monday/Thursday)
   */30 * * * 0,1,4 cd /path/to/sleeper && source venv/bin/activate && python sleeper_league_data.py
   
   # Alternative: using command line argument (if no .env file)
   0 * * 9-12,1 * cd /path/to/sleeper && source venv/bin/activate && python sleeper_league_data.py YOUR_LEAGUE_ID
   ```

#### On Windows (using Task Scheduler):

1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task
3. Set trigger (e.g., daily at specific times)
4. Set action to run: `python sleeper_league_data.py` (if using .env file) or `python sleeper_league_data.py YOUR_LEAGUE_ID`
5. Set start directory to your sleeper folder

### Recommended Update Frequency

- **During Games**: Every 15-30 minutes (for live scoring)
- **Regular Season**: 2-3 times per day
- **Off-season**: Once per day or less
- **Draft Day**: Every few minutes during active drafting

## üìÅ File Structure

After running the script, you'll have these files:

```
sleeper/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sleeper_league_data.py          # Main script with built-in web server
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sleeper_web_interface.html      # Player points interface (served by script)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html                      # Team rosters interface (served by script)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                       # This file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env                           # Configuration file (create this)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ venv/                          # Python virtual environment
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ league_XXXXXX_info.json        # League configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ league_XXXXXX_rosters.json     # Team rosters and standings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ league_XXXXXX_users.json       # League members
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ league_XXXXXX_matchups_week_X.json # Matchups for each week (1 through current)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ league_XXXXXX_draft_info.json  # Draft settings
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ league_XXXXXX_draft_picks.json # All draft picks
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ nfl_players.json               # Complete NFL player database (17MB)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nfl_state.json                 # Current NFL week/season info
```

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Multiple Leagues

To track multiple leagues, you have several options:

**Option 1: Multiple .env files**
```bash
# Create separate directories for each league
mkdir league1 league2
cp sleeper_league_data.py index.html league1/
cp sleeper_league_data.py index.html league2/

# Create .env file in each directory with different SLEEPER_LEAGUE_ID
echo "SLEEPER_LEAGUE_ID=1264686617134628864" > league1/.env
echo "SLEEPER_LEAGUE_ID=ANOTHER_LEAGUE_ID" > league2/.env
```

**Option 2: Command line arguments**
```bash
python sleeper_league_data.py 1264686617134628864
python sleeper_league_data.py ANOTHER_LEAGUE_ID
```

Each league will create its own set of JSON files.

### .env Configuration Options

The `.env` file supports the following configuration options:

```env
# Required: Your Sleeper League ID
SLEEPER_LEAGUE_ID=1264686617134628864

# Optional: Web server port (default: 8000)
WEB_SERVER_PORT=8000

# Optional: Update frequency for future scheduling features
UPDATE_FREQUENCY_MINUTES=30
UPDATE_DURING_GAMES_ONLY=true

# Optional: Data retention settings
KEEP_HISTORICAL_MATCHUPS=true
MAX_WEEKS_TO_KEEP=17
```

**Note**: Currently only `SLEEPER_LEAGUE_ID` is used by the script. Other options are reserved for future features.

### Automatic Port Selection

The script automatically finds an available port starting from 8000:
- If 8000 is available: uses 8000
- If 8000 is in use: tries 8001, 8002, etc.
- The script will display the actual port being used in the terminal

**No manual port configuration needed!**

### Data Analysis

All data is stored in JSON format for easy analysis:

```python
import json

# Load roster data
with open('league_XXXXXX_rosters.json', 'r') as f:
    rosters = json.load(f)

# Analyze team performance
for roster in rosters:
    team_name = roster.get('settings', {}).get('team_name', 'Unknown')
    wins = roster.get('settings', {}).get('wins', 0)
    points = roster.get('settings', {}).get('fpts', 0)
    print(f"{team_name}: {wins} wins, {points} points")
```

## üåê Web Interface Features

The interactive web interface provides two main views:

### **Player Points Interface** (`sleeper_web_interface.html`)
- **Week Selection**: Dropdown to choose any week (1 through current)
- **Player Cards**: Individual cards showing points, position, team
- **Starter Indicators**: Green highlighting for starting players
- **Team Rankings**: Teams sorted by total points for selected week
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all devices

### **Team Rosters Interface** (`index.html`)
- **Team Cards**: Each team displayed with standings and full roster
- **Player Information**: Real names, positions, and NFL teams
- **Visual Distinction**: Starters highlighted differently from bench players
- **Season Statistics**: Wins/losses, points for/against, waiver positions
- **Sortable**: Teams automatically sorted by wins, then points

### **Navigation**
- **Seamless Switching**: Navigate between views with navigation buttons
- **Consistent Design**: Both interfaces share the same modern styling
- **Mobile Friendly**: Navigation adapts to mobile devices

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Module not found: requests"**
```bash
# Make sure you're in the virtual environment
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install requests
```

**"HTTP 404: File not found" or "Failed to load data"**
- **SOLUTION**: You must run the Python script, not a simple HTTP server
- **WRONG**: `python3 -m http.server 8000`
- **CORRECT**: `python sleeper_league_data.py YOUR_LEAGUE_ID`
- The script includes a built-in web server that serves the interactive interface

**"Address already in use" (Port conflict)**
- The script automatically finds an available port (8001, 8002, etc.)
- Check the terminal output for the actual port being used
- If you see this error, kill any existing Python processes: `pkill -f python`

**"JSON.parse: unexpected character" error**
- This means the API endpoint isn't working properly
- Make sure you're running the Python script, not just serving static files
- Check the browser console (F12) for the actual error details

**"League not found"**
- Double-check your league ID
- Ensure the league is public or you have access
- Try the league ID from your Sleeper app URL

**Web interface shows error messages**
- The interface now provides detailed error messages with solutions
- Follow the troubleshooting steps shown in the error message
- Most issues are resolved by running the Python script correctly

### Getting Your League ID

1. Open Sleeper app or website
2. Go to your league
3. Look at the URL: `https://sleeper.app/leagues/YOUR_LEAGUE_ID/...`
4. Copy the long number (e.g., `1264686617134628864`)

## üìä API Rate Limits

The script respects Sleeper's API guidelines:
- Stays under 1000 calls per minute
- Includes small delays between requests
- Uses appropriate User-Agent header

## üîí Privacy & Security

- **Read-Only**: Script only reads data, cannot modify your league
- **No Authentication**: Uses public API endpoints only
- **Local Storage**: All data stored locally on your machine
- **No External Dependencies**: Web interface works offline after initial data fetch

## üÜò Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section above
2. Verify your league ID is correct
3. Ensure you have internet connectivity
4. Check that Python and required packages are installed
